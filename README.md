# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

## Overview
This project focuses on **Comparing Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithms vs. Individual Machine Learning Algorithms for House Price Prediction** using the King County, USA housing dataset. The primary goal of the research is to evaluate how ensemble learning methods compare to individual machine learning models in predicting house prices and to assess the effective performance benefits through ensemble algorithms.

Several algorithms are implemented, including:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **AdaBoost Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

The performance of these models is assessed using evaluation metrics such as:
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**

## Project Structure
